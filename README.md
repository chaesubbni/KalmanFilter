# Kalman Filter Study

This repository contains my study notes and implementations related to the Kalman Filter.




# Folders

## `Noise_filtering/`

  
This folder contains MATLAB code that applies a **Kalman Filter to correct noise** in sensor data.
It demonstrates how the filter smooths raw voltage readings and improves signal quality.


## 'Enhanced State Estimation Using Unobserved Variables/'


This folder contains MATLAB code that applies a ** Kalman Filter to observe state**.
we estimate unmeasurable values based on measurable ones, while also effectively reducing noise. Additionally, increasing the number of state variables can sometimes enhance noise reduction performance.
